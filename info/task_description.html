<p>
    In mathematics, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial">polynomial</a> is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that
    involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a mathematical expression with brackets and with one variable as a string.
    The expression contains "x", brackets and the following operators: <strong>+&nbsp;-&nbsp;*</strong>.
    You should convert this to a Polynomial.
    The power of "x" should be represented by "**".
</p>
<p> The final form of the polynomial should be in the following format:<p>
<pre>
     C<sub>N</sub>*x**n+C<sub>N1</sub>*x**(n-1)+...+C<sub>1</sub>*x+C<sub>0</sub>
    </pre>
<p>
    where<br>
    С<sub>N</sub>, С<sub>N1</sub> ...С<sub>1</sub>, С<sub>0</sub> - constants, integers.<br>
    if C = 0, then don't show this term (ex. 2*x**2+3). The only exception is alone zero (ex. "x-x" == "0").<br>
    if C = 1, then don't show C. (ex. x**2+2*x). Only if it's not С<sub>0</sub>.<br>
    if C = -1, then don't show C, only "-". (ex. x*x-x). Only if it's not С<sub>0</sub>.<br>
    if power of x is 1, then don't show power (ex. 5*x).

    Terms must be in descend order, sorted by the power of the variable.

<p><strong>Input: </strong>An expression as a string (unicode).</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>A polynomial as a string without whitespaces.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">
simplify("(x-1)*(x+1)") == "x**2-1"
simplify("(x+1)*(x+1)") == "x**2+2*x+1"
simplify("(x+3)*x*2-x*x") == "x**2+6*x"
simplify("x+x*x+x*x*x") == "x**3+x**2+x"
simplify("(2*x+3)*2-x+x*x*x*x") == "x**4+3*x+6"
simplify("x*x-(x-1)*(x+1)-1") == "0"
simplify("5-5-x") == "-x"
simplify("x*x*x-x*x*x-1") == "-1"
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    It's a very useful function for mathematical software. Time to get your head around it!
